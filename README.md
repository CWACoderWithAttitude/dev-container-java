# dev-container-java

An opinionated dev container for Java and VS Code

## Prerequisites

To make best use of this repository, you need the following:

- Visual Studio Code
- VS Code extension "Remote Development"
- Docker Desktop (MacOS, Windows) or docker engine (Linux)
- git client (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

Once you have the container running, open a terminal inside VS Code and execute the following sequence of commands:
